# Development Guidelines

## Project Integration

- Write code that is **simple** with clear **single responsibility**
- **Clear intent over clever code** - be boring and obvious; if you need to explain it, it's too complex
- Don't **prematurely abstract**
- Never **assume** things; ask the user via the AskUserQuestion tool and clarify upfront when needed

## Tooling and MCP use

- Always use `gh` CLI to access GitHub, never the GitHub MCP tool
- Always use `linear-cli` to interact with Linear, never the Linear MCP tool
- Use react-aria MCP to get latest documentation on React Aria Components
- Use Context7 MCP to validate current documentation about software libraries
